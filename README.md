## API 1
We searched for Horescope API and came accross [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/sameer.kumar/api/aztro/endpoints) which had [aztro](https://github.com/sameerkumar18/aztro)- The astrology API.

## Learnings

We kept getting this message in the terminal when `git merge main`
[Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19085807/please-enter-a-commit-message-to-explain-why-this-merge-is-necessary-especially)

To solve this:

1. press `i` (i for insert)
2. write your merge message
3. press `esc` (escape)
4. write `:wq` (write & quit)
5. then press **enter**
