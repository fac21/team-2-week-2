Blow 'em away

## User Journey 

We decided to create a website for a user to input their date of birth and receive a horoscope reading.From the data they receive they will get a giphy image in the output.

## API 1
We searched for Horescope API and came accross [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/sameer.kumar/api/aztro/endpoints) which had [aztro](https://github.com/sameerkumar18/aztro)- The astrology API.

## API 2

We had lots of trouble accessing our chosen second API [](https://rapidapi.com/astronomyapi-astronomyapi-default/api/astronomy) we chose required a URL. The github pages URL was not acceptable, so we tried using a custom domain. That didn't work and so we had trouble reverting that change. Finally we decided to use giphy API [](https://developers.giphy.com/)

## Learnings

We kept getting this message in the terminal when `git merge main`
[Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19085807/please-enter-a-commit-message-to-explain-why-this-merge-is-necessary-especially)

To solve this:

1. press `i` (i for insert)
2. write your merge message
3. press `esc` (escape)
4. write `:wq` (write & quit)
5. then press **enter**

**To reverse custom domain**
